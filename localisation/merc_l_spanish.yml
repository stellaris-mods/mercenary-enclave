# Introduction, after special project or timer
merc.introduction.desc: "Greetings! Let us just get right to it: the use of mercenaries in warfare has a long history. Much longer, in fact, than the deployment of national militaries to wage wars.\n\n$merc.name.colored$ is a business just like any other.
